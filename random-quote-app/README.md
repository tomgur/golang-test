# Demo React App

This is a demo React app that communicates with the [Random Quote API go app]
and uses 2 APIs 
*random-quote*
*bitcoin-price* 
and displays the results in a table.

The go app must be running for the React app to work.
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
You should use your local address (i.e. 192.168.0.12:3000), otherwise CORS will block the request to the API.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
